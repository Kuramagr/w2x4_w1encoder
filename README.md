# w2x4_w1encoder

This is my first attemp to programm a handwired macro keyboard with a arduino pro macro controller.

The code is still under development and i used some of the same code from my previous project with teensy 2 macro controller.

any suggestion or correction is much more than welcome.

hope i helped someone out there that his just starting now and needs a starting point.

have a nice day.

next project a macro controller 3x4 with 1 encoder.


Test code 2 is a success.
The .ino file is ready for you to put your shortcuts and use it as you like.

PARTS I USED

For a 3D print case i use the case https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4605764.
Its appsolute amazing and sitts very nice.

Keycaps still searching for a good .stl file.

Some pictures will be uploaded soon.

8 MX-keys
1 pro micro controller &
1 encoder

Connections

All the keys are direct to the pins of the pro micro and the other side to ground.
The encoder is connect the SW to 2 pinand DT to the 3 pin the CLK is connected to 4.
Be very carefull about where to connect the encoder because in the pro micro not all pins are for that use.
