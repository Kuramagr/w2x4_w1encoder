# w2x4_w1encoder

This is my first attemp to programm a handwired macro keyboard with a arduino pro macro controller.

The code is still under development and i used some of the same code from my previous project with teensy 2 macro controller.

any suggestion or correction is much more than welcome.

hope i helped someone out there that his just starting now and needs a starting point.

have a nice day.

next project a macro controller 3x4 with 1 encoder.
